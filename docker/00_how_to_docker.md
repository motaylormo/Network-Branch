1. Create a virtual machine with `docker-machine` using the `virtualbox` driver, and named `Char`.
2. Get the IP address of the `Char` virtual machine.
3. Define the variables needed by your virtual machine `Char` in the general env of your terminal, so that you can run the `docker ps` command without errors. You have to fix all four environment variables with one command, and you are not allowed to use your shell’s builtin to set these variables by hand.
4. Get the `hello-world `container from the Docker Hub, where it’s available.
5. Launch the `hello-world` container, and make sure that it prints its welcome message, then leaves it.
6. Launch an `nginx` container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task. It should be named `overlord`, be able to restart on its own, and have its 80 port attached to the 5000 port of `Char`. You can check that your container functions properly by visiting `http://<ip-de-char>:5000` on your web browser.
7. Get the internal IP address of the `overlord` container without starting its shell and in one command.
8. Launch a shell from an `alpine` container, and make sure that you can interact directly with the container via your terminal, and that the container deletes itself once the shell’s execution is done.
9. From the shell of a `debian` container, install via the container’s package manager everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git repo (of course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the container are updated). For this exercise, you should only specify the commands to be run directly in the container.
10. Create a volume named `hatchery`.
11. List all the Docker volumes created on the machine. Remember. VOLUMES.
12. Launch a `mysql` container as a background task. It should be able to restart on its own in case of error, and the root password of the database should be `Kerrigan`. You will also make sure that the database is stored in the `hatchery` volume, that the container directly creates a database named `zerglings`, and that the container itself is named `spawning-pool`.
13. Print the environment variables of the `spawning-pool` container in one command, to be sure that you have configured your container properly.
14. Launch a `wordpress` container as a background task, just for fun. The container should be named `lair`, its 80 port should be bound to the 8080 port of the virtual machine, and it should be able to use the `spawning-pool` container as a database service. You can try to access `lair` on your machine via a web browser, with the IP address of the virtual machine as a URL. Congratulations, you just deployed a functional Wordpress website in two commands!
15. Launch a `phpmyadmin` container as a background task. It should be named `roach-warden`, its 80 port should be bound to the 8081 port of the virtual machine and it should be able to explore the database stored in the `spawning-pool` container.
16. Look up the `spawning-pool` container’s logs in real time without running its shell.
17. Display all the currently active containers on the `Char` virtual machine.
18. Relaunch the `overlord` container.
19. Launch a container name `Abathur.` It will be a `Python` container, 2-slim version, its /root folder will be bound to a HOME folder on your host, and its 3000 port will be bound to the 3000 port of your virtual machine. You will personalize this container so that you can use the `Flask` micro-framework in its latest version. You will make sure that an html page displaying "Hello World" with `<h1>` tags can be served by `Flask`. You will test that your container is properly set up by accessing, via curl or a web browser, the IP address of your virtual machine on the 3000 port. You will also list all the necessary commands in your repository.
20. Create a local swarm, the `Char` virtual machine should be its manager.
21. Create another virtual machine with `docker-machine` using the `virtualbox` driver, and name it `Aiur`.
22. Turn `Aiur` into a slave of the local swarm in which `Char` is leader (the command to take control of `Aiur` is not requested).
23. Create an overlay-type internal network that you will name `overmind`.
24. Launch a `rabbitmq` SERVICE that will be named `orbital-command`. You should define a specific user and password for the RabbitMQ service, they can be whatever you want. This service will be on the `overmind` network.
25. List all the services of the local swarm.
26. Launch a `42school/engineering-bay` service in two replicas and make sure that the service works properly (see the documentation provided at hub.docker.com). This service will be named `engineering-bay` and will be on the `overmind` network.
27. Get the real-time logs of one the tasks of the `engineering-bay` service.
28. ... Damn it, a group of zergs is attacking `orbital-command`, and shutting down the `engineering-bay` service won’t help at all... You must send a troup of Marines to eliminate the intruders. Launch a `42school/marine-squad` in two replicas, and make sure that the service works properly (see the documentation provided at hub.docker.com). This service will be named... `marines` and will be on the `overmind` network.
29. Display all the tasks of the `marines` service.
30. Increase the number of copies of the `marines` service up to twenty, because there’s never enough Marines to eliminate Zergs. (Remember to take a look at the tasks and logs of the service, you’ll see, it’s fun.)
31. Force quit and delete all the services on the local swarm, in one command.
32. Force quit and delete all the containers (whatever their status), in one command.
33. Delete all the container images stored on the `Char` virtual machine, in one command as well.
34. Delete the `Aiur` virtual machine without using `rm -rf`.
